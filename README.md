# Nitro
Nitro is a asyncronous CLI tool that fetches packages based on GitHub repositories using the GitHub API.
It's currently only tested on Windows, so we can't ensure any features to work on other systems.

# How do I install it?
Download the `Nitro-windows-amd64.exe` and the `setup.bat` file out of the (latest Release)[https://github.com/NoahOnFyre/Nitro/]. Open up a command prompt in your current directory and execute the following command.
```
setup
```
The setup will automatically start the Nitro CLI.

# How do I use it?
Open up a command prompt and run the `nitro` command to start the CLI.
If you need help for the commands, try the `help` command.
